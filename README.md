# **Portfolio Projects**<br>
Welcome to my portfolio of data analysis and automation projects! This repository showcases a variety of scripts and tools I've developed to tackle different challenges in data collection, processing, and visualization. Each project highlights a specific skill set and demonstrates my ability to work with various data sources and technologies.

## **Projects**
### **Amazon Web Scraper**<br>
This script monitors the price of a specific product on Amazon by scraping its webpage. It extracts the product's title and price, logs this information to a CSV file, and updates the file every hour to track price changes over time.

### **Automate API Extraction + Appending Data**<br>
Utilizing the CoinMarketCap API, this script fetches cryptocurrency data, processes it, and visualizes trends over time. It appends the latest data to a CSV file, calculates average percentage changes over various timeframes, and creates point and line plots using Seaborn to highlight trends for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

### **Covid Project - Data Exploration**<br>
This script provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, summarizing cases, deaths, and calculating death percentages. It compares infection and death rates across locations, merges death data with vaccination data, and visualizes the progress with various views for a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

### **Movie Correlation Project**<br>
In this project, I analyze a movie dataset to explore the relationship between budget and gross earnings. The script cleans and prepares the data, visualizes correlations using scatter plots and regression plots, and creates correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify high correlations between features like budget, gross, runtime, score, votes, and year.

### **Nashville Housing - Data Cleaning Project**<br>
This script focuses on cleaning and standardizing data in the NashvilleHousing table. Key operations include standardizing date formats, populating missing property addresses, splitting address information, converting values in specific fields, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns.

Feel free to explore the scripts and their detailed documentation. Each project demonstrates a unique approach to solving data-related problems and showcases my proficiency in data analysis, web scraping, and automation.
