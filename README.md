Covid Project - Data ExplorationÂº

This script analyzes COVID-19 data by summarizing cases, deaths, and calculating death percentages. It compares infection and death rates across different locations and populations, and also merges COVID-19 death data with vaccination data to track progress. Additionally, the script creates views for easier data visualization, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress.

Nashville Housing- Data Cleaning Project

This script cleans and standardizes data in the NashvilleHousing table by performing several operations. It standardizes date formats, populates missing property addresses, splits address information into individual columns (address, city, state), converts 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "Sold as Vacant" field, removes duplicate records, and deletes unused columns.
